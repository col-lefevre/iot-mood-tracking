## Overview

MoodMap is an Internet of Things mood tracker which I created as an Informatics Undergradate student at Indiana University, specifically for I341 Prototyping with Arduino Tools. My main objective was applying my experience with digital UX/UI design to physical prototyping. The result was a physical mood tracking device and a companion mobile app.

## Features

MoodMap is comprised of a physical device and a companion mobile app. Users can:
- [MoodMap] Record their moods on a 3-point spectrum
- [App] Review tracked moods
- [App] Change the moods being tracked

## Resources

- [MoodMap] Built using an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) and C++
- [App] Built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and many, many libraries
- [Both] IoT communication via a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database
